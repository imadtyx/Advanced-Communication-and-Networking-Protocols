# Advanced-Communication-and-Networking-Protocols

This repository contains the practicals performed as a part of the course IT706 Advanced Communication and Networking Protocols offered at the university. The focus of this course is to mainly understand advanced/modern topics in networking like congestion control, network programming, light weight IP stack for embedded devices, software-defined networks, data centric networking, web services and protocols for modern networks.

All of these practicals require at least the following knowledge:
1. Computer Networks.
2. Experience working with Cisco Packet Tracer (version 7.3.0).
3. Intermediate level knowledge about C language.

So far, five practicals are attempted. I shall be adding more practicals as I progress through the course. The objectives for each of the practicals are listed below:
